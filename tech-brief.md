# Technical Brief: Personal Finance Tracking Application

## Overview
A single-user application to track personal expenses, visualize spending patterns, and predict future bills. The application will use React, Next.js, and Material-UI (MUI) for the frontend, with data initially sourced from a JSON file.

## Project Initialization Commands

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@latest finance-tracker --typescript

# Navigate to the project directory
cd finance-tracker

# Install Material-UI and related dependencies
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material

# Install data visualization and utility libraries
npm install recharts date-fns uuid simple-statistics

# Optional: Install additional libraries based on needs
npm install @mui/x-data-grid    # For advanced table functionality
npm install @mui/x-date-pickers # For date picking components

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

After initialization, create the initial project structure:

```bash
# Create core directories
mkdir -p src/components/dashboard
mkdir -p src/components/expenses
mkdir -p src/components/common
mkdir -p src/lib
mkdir -p src/data
mkdir -p src/types
mkdir -p src/hooks
```

Create a sample data file at `src/data/expenses.json`:

```bash
touch src/data/expenses.json
```

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts (recommended)
- **Prediction Library**: Simple-Statistics or TensorFlow.js (depending on complexity needs)
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux Toolkit
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON file (initial), with potential for localStorage or IndexedDB

## Key Features

### 1. Dashboard View
- Spending summary cards
- Monthly expense breakdown
- Category-based spending visualization
- Trend analysis charts
- Upcoming bill predictions

### 2. Bill Entry Interface
- Form to add new expenses
- Table to view/edit existing expenses
- Category management
- Date range filtering
- Search functionality

## Data Structure
```json
{
  "expenses": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "amount": 120.50,
      "category": "Utilities",
      "subcategory": "Electricity",
      "date": "2023-10-15",
      "recurrence": "monthly",
      "notes": "Higher than usual due to AC usage"
    }
  ],
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "cat-uuid",
      "name": "Utilities",
      "color": "#4287f5",
      "subcategories": ["Electricity", "Water", "Internet", "Gas"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Application Architecture

### Pages
- `/` - Dashboard with visualizations and predictions
- `/expenses` - Bill entry and management interface
- `/settings` - Application settings (optional)

### Components
1. **Dashboard Components**
   - `SummaryCards` - Quick overview of spending
   - `ExpenseChart` - Visualize spending by category/time
   - `PredictionPanel` - Display upcoming predicted expenses
   - `TrendAnalysis` - Show spending trends over time

2. **Expense Management Components**
   - `ExpenseForm` - Add/edit expenses
   - `ExpenseTable` - Display and manage expenses
   - `CategoryManager` - Manage expense categories
   - `FilterPanel` - Filter expenses by date/category

## Data Visualization & Prediction

### Recommended Libraries
- **Recharts** - React-based charting library that's easy to use and highly customizable
- **Simple-Statistics** - For basic trend analysis and predictions
- **date-fns** - For date manipulation and calculations

### Visualization Types
- Bar charts for category comparison
- Line charts for spending over time
- Pie charts for category distribution
- Heat maps for spending intensity

### Prediction Methods
- Moving averages for recurring expenses
- Linear regression for trend-based predictions
- Pattern recognition for seasonal expenses

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure
- Initialize Next.js project
- Set up MUI theming
- Create basic page layouts
- Implement data loading from JSON

### Phase 2: Expense Management
- Build expense entry form
- Create expense table with CRUD operations
- Implement filtering and searching

### Phase 3: Visualization & Dashboard
- Implement charts and graphs
- Create summary components
- Design responsive dashboard layout

### Phase 4: Predictions & Analysis
- Implement basic prediction algorithms
- Add trend analysis
- Create prediction visualizations

### Phase 5: Refinement & Optimization
- Improve UI/UX
- Optimize performance
- Add data export/import features

## Future Enhancements
- Data persistence with a backend database
- Cloud synchronization
- Budget setting and alerts
- Receipt scanning and OCR
- Multiple currency support
- Dark/light theme toggle

## Development Notes
- Use Next.js App Router for routing
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Consider accessibility requirements
- Use TypeScript for type safety

This technical brief provides a foundation for developing your personal finance tracking application. The architecture is designed to be simple yet extensible, allowing for future enhancements as needed.
