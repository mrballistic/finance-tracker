# Technical Context for Personal Finance Tracking Application

## Overview
This document captures the technical context and details for the Personal Finance Tracking Application project based on the provided technical brief.

## Project Description
A single-user personal finance tracking application designed to track expenses, visualize spending patterns, and predict future bills. The application is built using React and Next.js with Material-UI (MUI) for the frontend UI components. Initial data is sourced from a local JSON file.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js (using App Router)
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI)
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts (React-based charting library)
- **Date Manipulation:** date-fns
- **Unique ID Generation:** uuid
- **Statistics & Prediction:** simple-statistics (for basic trend analysis and predictions), with potential future use of TensorFlow.js for more complex predictions
- **State Management:** React Context API or Redux Toolkit (to be decided)
- **Data Storage:** Local JSON file initially, with potential future use of localStorage or IndexedDB for persistence

## Project Initialization
- Created with `npx create-next-app@latest finance-tracker --typescript`
- Installed dependencies:
  - `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, `@mui/icons-material`
  - `recharts`, `date-fns`, `uuid`, `simple-statistics`
  - Optional: `@mui/x-data-grid` (advanced tables), `@mui/x-date-pickers` (date pickers)
- Core directories created under `src/`:
  - `components/dashboard`
  - `components/expenses`
  - `components/common`
  - `lib`
  - `data`
  - `types`
  - `hooks`
- Sample data file: `src/data/expenses.json`

## Application Architecture

### Pages
- `/` - Dashboard with visualizations and predictions
- `/expenses` - Bill entry and management interface
- `/settings` - Application settings (optional)

### Components

#### Dashboard Components
- `SummaryCards` - Quick overview of spending
- `ExpenseChart` - Visualize spending by category and time
- `PredictionPanel` - Display upcoming predicted expenses
- `TrendAnalysis` - Show spending trends over time

#### Expense Management Components
- `ExpenseForm` - Add/edit expenses
- `ExpenseTable` - Display and manage expenses
- `CategoryManager` - Manage expense categories
- `FilterPanel` - Filter expenses by date and category

## Data Structure

```json
{
  "expenses": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "amount": 120.50,
      "category": "Utilities",
      "subcategory": "Electricity",
      "date": "2023-10-15",
      "recurrence": "monthly",
      "notes": "Higher than usual due to AC usage"
    }
  ],
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "cat-uuid",
      "name": "Utilities",
      "color": "#4287f5",
      "subcategories": ["Electricity", "Water", "Internet", "Gas"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Visualization & Prediction

### Visualization Types
- Bar charts for category comparison
- Line charts for spending over time
- Pie charts for category distribution
- Heat maps for spending intensity

### Prediction Methods
- Moving averages for recurring expenses
- Linear regression for trend-based predictions
- Pattern recognition for seasonal expenses

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure
- Initialize Next.js project
- Set up MUI theming
- Create basic page layouts
- Implement data loading from JSON

### Phase 2: Expense Management
- Build expense entry form
- Create expense table with CRUD operations
- Implement filtering and searching

### Phase 3: Visualization & Dashboard
- Implement charts and graphs
- Create summary components
- Design responsive dashboard layout

### Phase 4: Predictions & Analysis
- Implement basic prediction algorithms
- Add trend analysis
- Create prediction visualizations

### Phase 5: Refinement & Optimization
- Improve UI/UX
- Optimize performance
- Add data export/import features

## Future Enhancements
- Data persistence with backend database
- Cloud synchronization
- Budget setting and alerts
- Receipt scanning and OCR
- Multiple currency support
- Dark/light theme toggle

## Development Notes
- Use Next.js App Router for routing
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Consider accessibility requirements
- Use TypeScript for type safety

This technical context document serves as a foundation for ongoing development and future enhancements of the personal finance tracking application.
