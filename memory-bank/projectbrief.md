# Project Brief: Personal Finance Tracking Application

## Purpose
To develop a single-user application that helps individuals track their personal expenses, visualize spending patterns, and predict future bills. The application aims to provide an intuitive and extensible platform for managing personal finances effectively.

## Core Requirements
- Track and manage personal expenses with detailed categorization.
- Visualize spending data through various charts and graphs.
- Predict upcoming bills and spending trends using statistical methods.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for entering and managing expenses.
- Support data persistence initially via local JSON, with future plans for backend integration.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Accessibility considerations to ensure usability for all users.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

## Goals
- Deliver a functional MVP with core expense tracking and visualization features.
- Build a scalable architecture that supports future enhancements like cloud sync and OCR.
- Ensure a smooth and engaging user experience with Material-UI components.
- Implement basic prediction algorithms for recurring and seasonal expenses.
- Provide filtering, searching, and category management capabilities.

## Constraints
- Initial data storage limited to local JSON files.
- Single-user focus; no multi-user or authentication features initially.
- Use React with Next.js and Material-UI as the primary frontend technologies.
- Keep the application lightweight and performant.

## Success Criteria
- Users can add, edit, and delete expenses easily.
- Visualizations accurately reflect the user's spending data.
- Predictions provide useful insights into upcoming bills.
- The UI is responsive and accessible.
- The codebase is well-structured and maintainable.

This project brief serves as the foundation for all subsequent design, development, and documentation efforts.
