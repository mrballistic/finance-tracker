# Active Context for Personal Finance Tracking Application

## Current Work Focus
- Built and integrated the SummaryCards and ExpenseChart components into the dashboard page.
- Resolved TypeScript and import errors related to Material-UI Grid and Recharts.
- Established a functional dashboard UI with sample data visualization.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored SummaryCards component to use Box with flexbox layout instead of Grid to fix typing issues.
- Added "use client" directive to ExpenseChart component to fix server component import error.
- Updated main page to include the new dashboard components with sample data.

## Next Steps
- Implement dynamic data loading and state management for expenses.
- Build expense entry and management interfaces.
- Add filtering, searching, and category management features.
- Continue developing dashboard visualizations and prediction components.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using React Context API or Redux Toolkit for state management to be finalized.
- Data persistence strategy to evolve from local JSON to more robust solutions.
- Accessibility and responsive design remain priorities.
- Prediction algorithms to start simple and evolve in complexity.

This active context document will be updated continuously to reflect the current state and decisions of the project.
