# System Patterns for Finance Tracker

## UI/UX Design Patterns

### Visual Design Principles
- Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention through the finance application
- Use a cohesive color palette that reflects financial trust and clarity
- Implement typography that emphasizes readability for financial data and statistics
- Maintain sufficient contrast for legibility (WCAG 2.1 AA standard)
- Design with consistent visual style across dashboard, expenses, and settings pages

### Interaction Design Patterns
- Create intuitive navigation between dashboard and expense management views
- Use familiar UI components from Material-UI to reduce cognitive load
- Provide clear calls-to-action for expense entry and management functions
- Implement responsive design to work on both desktop and mobile devices
- Use animations judiciously for data transitions and feedback

### Accessibility Standards
- Follow WCAG guidelines for web accessibility throughout the application
- Use semantic HTML to enhance screen reader compatibility
- Provide alternative text for chart visualizations and non-text content
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements
- Test with assistive technologies to validate accessibility

## Responsive Design Architecture

### Fluid Layout Approach
- Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels
- Implement CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts (currently used in SummaryCards)
- Design with a mobile-first approach, then scale up for larger displays

### Breakpoints and Media Queries
- Use breakpoints to adjust layouts for different screen sizes
- Focus content presentation on user needs rather than specific devices
- Test designs across various device sizes and orientations

### Touch and Interaction Targets
- Ensure interactive elements are large enough for touch (min 44x44 pixels)
- Provide adequate spacing between touch targets in expense forms
- Use appropriate input types for better mobile experiences in expense entry

## Component Design Patterns

### Data Visualization Components
- Use Recharts for consistent chart rendering
- Implement responsive container wrappers for all charts
- Apply consistent color coding for expense categories
- Ensure all charts include proper labeling and legends

### Form Components
- Standardize form layouts for expense entry and filters
- Use appropriate input validation with clear error messages
- Implement consistent form action placement across the application

### Layout Components
- Use ThemeProvider for consistent styling
- Apply consistent spacing and alignment throughout the UI
- Maintain predictable page structure across different views

## Performance Optimization

### Asset Optimization
- Optimize images and assets to minimize load times
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Use code splitting to improve initial load performance

### State Management
- Use React Context API for global state management
- Implement efficient rendering strategies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Separate UI state from data state where appropriate
